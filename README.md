### Sources Used
There was no need for the sources to be used to write direct code as I am already well aware of the React, Ant-Design, NodeJs and MongoDB but I have used the references to go over the concepts and brush up some topics which are mentioned under references. 


### Author's work
We all contributed requally to the project. Still I worked on this files:
